    <h2> Descriptionc </h2>
    <p> From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes. </p>
    <p> There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese. </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil </li>
        <li> 1 pound ground beef chuck </li>
        <li> 1/2 medium onion, diced </li>
        <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li> 3 ounces tomato paste </li>
        <li> A lot more! </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor. </li>
        <li> Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor! </li>
        <li> From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients. </li>
        <li> Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat! </li>

    </ol>
